We have separate folder for each task in both of the folder , Milestone 2 code and milestone 3 code.


Task1 and Task2
We will need to upload the *.ipynb files to collab along with *.tsv files. Collab will already have packages installed and rest will get installed via the %pip command. We can then use run all command to generate the outputs


Task 3: Event Prediction
Baseline:
The code is present as a jupyter notebook in Codebase/Milestone 2/task3.ipynb.
Upload the input data named - task_3_event_prediction.tsv


The notebook has variables - 
hist: historical data to consider
future: how many days in the future will predictions be made


The results are reported for hist = 5, Lead time = 1

Final:
The code is present as a jupyter notebook in Codebase/Milestone 3 code/taks3.ipynb. 


Runtime - GPU
Upload the input data named - task_3_event_prediction.tsv


The notebook has variables - 
hist: historical data to consider
future: how many days in the future will predictions be made
fine_tune: fine-tune transformer network or not.


The results reported are based on customizing each of these variables and running all the cells in the notebook.


Note: results may be slightly different as is the case with ML/DL models.
